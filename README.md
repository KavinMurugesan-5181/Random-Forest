# Random-Forest
A potent tree learning method in machine learning is the Random Forest algorithm. During the training stage, it generates many Decision Trees. To measure a random subset of characteristics in each partition, a random subset of the data set is used to build each tree. Because each tree is more variable as a result of the randomization, there is less chance of overfitting and overall prediction performance is enhanced. When making predictions, the algorithm averages (for regression tasks) or votes (for classification tasks) the output of each tree. The findings of this cooperative decision-making process, which is aided by the insights of several trees, are consistent and accurate. Regression and classification algorithms frequently employ random forests because of their propensity to handle complex data, minimize
